        <h3>What is the Purpose of this Program?</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the Surrogate Avatar Experience is to enable individuals to remotely explore and interact with
            environments and events that they may not be physically present for. This technology is designed to provide
            a unique and immersive experience, breaking down geographical barriers and allowing you to engage in
            activities and events from the comfort of your own location.</p>

        <h3>How it works:</h3>
        <p>SuAvE organizes a connection between the physical and virtual planes of learning. The virtual plane involves
            a remote participant who would require and utilize the surrogate avatar to have physical embodiment. The
            physical plane involves the surrogate avatar, whom is a volunteer, to take on the responsibility of being
            the remote personnelâ€™s physical attendance to offer embodied action-based experiences. As such, it is an
            entirely volunteer-driven project, and requires consent of all volunteers before proceeding.</p>
